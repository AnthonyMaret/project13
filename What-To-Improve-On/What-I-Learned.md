This is just a small readme compiling what I've learned from this project.

Multiple times during the editing of files, I had made mistakes with either syntax or typos.
In the future I will definitely pay more attention and double-check my inputs.
- Transposed numbers or letters.
- Wrong inputs all together.
- Incorrect spacing or syntax.

Additionally, I did take screenshots on my second day of the project. 

I didn't feel at first that screenshots on the first day were necessary, but in retrospect I definitely wish I took some.
So with that being said, going forward, I'm going to document my work better, not only for myself, but for others.

Lastly, and most importantly. I feel like I have a habit of working too fast, which leads to the problems above.
So from now on, I'm going to slow down so I can better intake information that I'm reading and reduce the mistakes I make the first go-around.
